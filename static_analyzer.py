# Some triggers:
"""

print_var_name, ret_var_name, shell_var_name


We limit ourselves to print("--explore", obj[attr].attr[0]).
Note that it can't be f"bruh:{bruh}" as it's not helpful
GOOD: we actually receives the entire object
BAD: will need to infer the name somehow
When it is the object itself, can just loop through locals() to find the obj; otherwise need to look at the code itself



NEED: extracting print_var_name, given the line of code. (Shouldn't be that bad?)
NEED: deparse the name passed in to (someobj)[attr].attr[0] or sth
NEED: assert that print_var_name is in ret_var_name
NEED: given that ret_var_name is returned from the same function that shell_var_name calls, associate the two


# Does the return name match with the outer scope's name? (True, False)

 
# Does the return name match the name being feed into result? If not, then is that name
a subset of result? (Happens to share the same name, subset, same)
- Can go see whether the return parts includes a subset of print_var_name.
- Can't do much when they only happen to share the same name.
- If no, then attempts to go up and find the closest place that defined assigned the print_var_name to a subset of 
ret_var_name 

# Is a loop involved? If so, do we know the index somehow? (direct index, enumerate, foreach loop)

- For direct index and enumerate, can just find the current index object (go up and find the nearest loop that defines n)
 in the locals()
- For foreach, can probably infer using list.find(x), and as we are generating tests it shouldn't matter 
the exact position that we are checking.

# Is a conditional statement involved, i.e. does the print only work in certain conds? (True/False)
- This shouldn't really matter, as we hijack all of the prints. This will only run when it's needed
